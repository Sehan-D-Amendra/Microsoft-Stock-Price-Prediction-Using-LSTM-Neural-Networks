# üìà Microsoft Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks
### Project Overview üöÄ
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for predicting Microsoft (MSFT) stock prices. The project demonstrates the power of deep learning in financial time series forecasting, utilizing advanced LSTM architecture to capture complex temporal patterns in stock market data.

### üß† LSTM Technology Deep Dive
**Why LSTM for Stock Prediction?**
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) specifically designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem that traditional RNNs face when processing long sequences. For stock prediction, LSTMs offer several key advantages:

- Memory Cells: Can store information over extended time periods, crucial for capturing long-term market trends
- Forget Gate: Selectively discards irrelevant historical information while retaining important patterns
- Input Gate: Controls which new information gets stored in the memory cell
- Output Gate: Determines what information should be used for predictions at each timestep
- Temporal Dependencies: Excels at learning from sequential data where past events influence future outcomes

### LSTM Architecture Implementation
Our model features a sophisticated dual-LSTM architecture with the following components:
